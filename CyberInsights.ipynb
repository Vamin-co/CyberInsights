    "# CyberInsight: Visualizing Modern Cybersecurity Threats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CyberInsight** project aims to explore and visualize the landscape of modern cybersecurity threats through data-driven storytelling. By analyzing real-world data on various types of cyberattacks, such as malware, phishing, denial-of-service, and supply chain attacks, this project reveals patterns in attack frequency, severity, and targeted industries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python-based visualizations, we derive meaningful insights about how these threats evolve over time, how they affect different sectors, and what trends emerge from the data. Our goal is to make these complex patterns understandable through clear, annotated charts and interactive visual formats. The final output includes a series of polished visualizations accompanied by detailed explanations, all compiled into a public GitHub repository and presentation for public viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work not only highlights the growing scale of cybersecurity risks but also empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions based on visual evidence.\n"
